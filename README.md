# SportsBuddy
This is a social media app for sport lovers

Project description

This is a social media app created to find sport buddies. If you want to start running and don't want to do that alone you can find running buddies in the area and run together. If you want to play basketball and lack one player, you can make a post in basketball group in the app and find people who can come play with you. If you want to start exercising and need a good coach, this is app for you. We have a database of the best fitness coaches in the area to help you. We provide ratings and rates for each coach. You can also see their time availability and message them in the app. This is a social media app. You can communicate, share pictures, write reviews. It is a free app for users. 

Team

I am looking for 8-10 developers, since it is a big project that requires a lot of thinking and ideas.

Implementation

We plan to implement the MVP using an SQL, then migrate to NoSQL once the app has a lot of users.

Business

Technical

1. First we need to come up with the structure. How exactly we will organize the app to fulfill its purposes
2. Then we will design several tables for our database. One for users, another for coaches (with all of their qualifications). One more is for activities (running, walking, basketball, volleball, etc.)
3. Choose programming languages and platforms.

Social

The best way to gain an audience is by the word of mouth. Of course we will start by advertising on popular social media platforms. Then, we can talk to companies like Nike or Adidas to get a discount for reffered friends in the app.
