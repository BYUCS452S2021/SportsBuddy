Hello!

I'm interested in joining this project. I've taken CS classes where we learned some SQL and Android Development. So, I should be able to help with both, the development
of the frontend and the backend.

This project interests me because I enjoy morning exercising and I see that many people do, so it would be nice to develop an App where people who share this same love
for any sport can find each other to play together. And I think that this App has a lot of potential of growth here in Provo.

The business end I think a free social media App is definitely the way to go. Adding ads in the future would be great!

For Operation, the idea that founders should operate the company is desirable, and I also like the idea of potentially selling it to a bigger company in the future.

As for legal. My guess is that introducing ads on an App wouldn't present any legal challanges. However, as the App and income grows, it'll be important to consult a
legal expert.

For technical. I agree, first we need to come up with the structure and class diagrams, as well as design the several tables for our database. As far as programming languages go, I would choose the programming language the team is more familiar with. For Android App Applications, I'm most familiar with Java and Kotlin.

For social. I agree, word of mouth is the best way to help this app to grow. We can achieve this by sharing posts on Facebook and letting friends and roommates know about it.
